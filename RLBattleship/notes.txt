Environment: 

self.ship_state -> state space with ship positions (stored within env)

'ss0000' -> 'ssm000' -> 'hsm000' -> 'hhm000' no s = finish

Track both states in parallel

self.game_state -> state space without ship positions (given to agent)


read_state(state: str) -> list // Pass in the state name. Return state space list


mark(marked_index: int) -> str, bool, float // Pass in index that you want to fire at. Return next state and Boolean indicating game finish and reward as float/int


game_end(state: str) -> bool // Determine if the ship is sunk


game_start(optional coordinate) -> str // Set up the state and place random ship on random spot on board and return state. 


place_ship() -> str // Select a random string 'ssss' and return the state str. Select 1 random position and then place ship randomly in valid orientation


get_terminal_flag (helper method) 'ssss' == 'hhhh' -> terminal. 's0000s' == 'h0000h'


get_reward: hit = 10, sink = 100, miss = -1
